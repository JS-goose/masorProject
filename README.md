![a design of the website](../src/assets/images/preview.jpg)

This project is a freelance Angular application for an annuities company.  It's one of my first ventures into designing the entire website as well as building it.

I will not accpet pull requests but you are free to use the code as you see fit, as long as you attribute me in the code.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
